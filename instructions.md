# PROJECT 2  - due Saturday 02/29

## Requirements:

● Must use a Node/Express Web Server powering your own API
● Must be backed by a MySQL Database with a Sequelize ORM
     (https://sequelize.org/v5/manual/getting-started.html,
     https://github.com/sequelize/cli)
● Must have both GET and POST routes for retrieving and
     adding new data
● Must be deployed using Heroku with a JawsDB MySQL
     add-onMust utilize at least two new libraries, packages, or
     technologies that we haven't discussed
● Must have a polished frontend / UI (this is important for
     showcasing your projects as first impressions will normally
     be made based on the UI)
● Must have folder structure that meets or mimics MVC
Paradigm
● Must meet good quality coding standards (indentation,
     scoping, naming)
● Must not expose sensitive API key information on the server
     (we will talk about this later)

## Bonus
● Implement user authentication (roll your own with express/passport — we will demo this, use a service like Auth0 https://auth0.com/ or firebase)
● Write tests for your server, UI, etc (we will also cover this in one of the project week workshops)

 ● Setup continuous integration (CI) with Circle/Travis CI to automatically run listing/tests on each push and further protect your master branch (we will also have a workshop dedicated to this)
● Implement an admin dashboard that allows app admins to control/view your user data (we will discuss this a bit as well)

## Day 1: Objectives
- Identify three potential app ideas ranked from favorite to
least favorite then create a group chat between me/Andrea/ram
and the rest of your team and slack us all the list.  One of us
will come over and discuss them with your team (or hop on a
slack call in my case) and approve one of your ideas
- Once your idea has been approved, start thinking about your
MVP (what can I get done by next Thursday 02/20 as a minimal,
standalone product that I can demo in order to prove my concept)
- Sketch some of the preliminary views/pages/screens for your
MVP on pencil and paper and think about the data that will be
required to power your app/pages
- Iron out the data model that will be used to describe the
different pieces of data you've discussed.  What tables will you
need in your DB to represent your data? what columns will each
table require? how are your different pieces of data related —
one-to-one (1:1), one-to-many (1:N), many-to-many (N:M)?

 - Setup your GitHub repository with master branch protections
and add everyone on your teammates as a collaborator including
myself, ram and Andrea
- Work on setting up your initial project (check out

F-PT-10-2019-U-C/tree/master/14-Handlebars/Day%203/16-MvcExample
)
- Discuss how you want to distribute the workload (e.g. who will
work on backend/frontend?  what parts?)
- Work on more refined mockups/sections of your app using a tool
like Figma (https://www.figma.com/,
https://www.figmaresources.com/resources/figma-wireframe-ui-kit,
https://www.figmaresources.com/resources/cjcf8oodrfuhpfyls,
https://www.figmaresources.com/resources/figma-material-design-l
ibrary)
- Work on a more refined version of your database models using a
db schema design tool such as sqldbm
(https://app.sqldbm.com/MySQL/Draft/)
- Send the group chat between me, Andrea, ram and your team an
outline of your idea, the mvp you've identified, some
mockups/wireframes of that mvp, and your preliminary database
schema by the end of class
